#2048 Game Written in Javascript

The goal of the game is to make the 2048 block. By using the directions left, right, up, and down, you can shift all of the blocks towards that direction's wall. If the 2 blocks of the same number collide, they will combine to become a block of double the size. Every move will randomly place a new block on the board. Try to reach the 2048 block before the board completely fills up.

Good Luck!
